## The Science of Rainbows

Rainbows are formed through the process of refraction, dispersion, and reflection of light in water droplets. When sunlight enters a droplet, it bends and splits into its component colors, creating the arc of a rainbow that we see in the sky.

### Key Factors Influencing Rainbow Formation
- **Sunlight Angle**: The position of the sun affects the visibility of the rainbow. Rainbows are typically seen when the sun is low in the sky.
- **Water Droplets**: Rain or mist is essential for the formation of a rainbow, acting as the medium that refracts light.

## Cultural Significance of Rainbows

Rainbows hold significant cultural meanings in various societies. They are often seen as symbols of hope, promise, and peace. For example:
- In many cultures, rainbows are viewed as a bridge between the earthly and the divine.
- In LGBTQ+ communities, the rainbow flag represents diversity and inclusivity.

### Art
