# The Rarest Eye Color in the World: Green

Green eyes are often considered the rarest eye color globally, captivating many with their enchanting hue. This article delves into the genetics, cultural significance, and fascinating traits associated with green eyes.

## Understanding Eye Color Genetics

Eye color is determined by the amount and type of pigments present in the iris, as well as the way light scatters in the eye. The two primary pigments are:

- **Melanin**: Brown eyes have high levels of melanin, while blue eyes have very little.
- **Lipochrome**: This pigment contributes to green and hazel eyes.

### The Genetics Behind Green Eyes

Green eyes occur due to a combination of low to moderate melanin and a specific variation in the genetic makeup associated with eye color. The genes OCA2 and HERC2 play a significant role in determining eye color. 

- **OCA2**: Influences the production of melanin.
- **HERC2**: Contains a regulatory element that controls OCA2, affecting the level of melanin production.

Approximately **2%** of the worldâ€™s population has green eyes, making them exceptionally rare. 

## The Global Distribution of Green Eyes

Green eyes are most commonly found in:

- **Northern and Central Europe**: Particularly in countries like Ireland and Scotland, where the frequency of green eyes can be as high as 20%.
- **Parts of the Middle East**: Such as Iran, where green eyes are also observed, albeit less frequently.
